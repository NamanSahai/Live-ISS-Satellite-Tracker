# Live ISS Satellite Tracker

Curious where the International Space Station is right now? This Python tool helps you track the ISS in real time and see its position mapped over Earth.

## What does it do?

- Fetches the latest orbital data for the ISS
- Calculates and prints the live latitude, longitude, and altitude of the space station
- Draws the ISS’s current spot on a world map for easy visualization

## Technologies used

- Python
- Skyfield (for satellite data)
- Matplotlib & Cartopy (for map drawing)

## Setup

Install the necessary packages with this one-line command:

pip install skyfield matplotlib cartopy

text

## How to use

Just run:

python satellite_tracker.py

text

The program will display the ISS’s current coordinates in your terminal and open a map that marks its location on Earth.

## Why try it?

This project is ideal if you’re interested in Python, real-world data, space, or geospatial visualization. It’s educational, practical, and fun to see an actual satellite racing overhead!
